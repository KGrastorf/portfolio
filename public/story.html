    <h1 class="fontq2">An Artist at heart.</h1>

    <blockquote class="fontq">"Theatre is a voyage into the archives of the human imagination.""<br />-Natasha Tsakos</blockquote>
    <br />

    <p class="fontq3">For many years I was an Actor/Singer who traveled the country. Not only was I a performer, I worked as a technician (carpentry, lighting and sound) and a manager (Stage Manager and Operations Manager). This experience was challenging and rewarding. It helped me develop a strong work ethic along with the tenacity to stick with something until I get it to work or find another way. Early on I worked in Alaska and that set me on a different path.</p>
    <br />
    <blockquote class="fontq">"The mountains are calling and I must go" <br /> -John Muir</blockquote>
    <br />
    <p class="fontq3">Though I traveled to many places, I would always return to the mountains. At first it was just Alaska, then it became Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. I eventually turned to seasonal work where I was a Manager in Food and Beverage for several years. Most recently I managed the Dining Rooms in Yellowstone. That is when I discovered Bozeman.</p>

    <blockquote class="fontq">"Love is like a tree, it grows of its own accord, it puts down deep roots into our whole being." <br /> -Victor Hugo</blockquote>
    <br />
    <p class="fontq3">So, now I am here in Montana, putting down roots. I have enjoyed traveling and would like to stay put now. I am fortunate enough to be able to start over again in the business of Web Development and I look forard to see where it takes me.
